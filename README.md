# TravelWebsite
This is a fun project I did when I was learning web development. It is a website named Young Travel targeting the young travellers who want to explore the world without breaking their banks. It has all the information regarding the hot global travel spots. Users can create accounts and interact with each other through comment sections. 


The project includes:
- app.py (python file to run the website)
- static (a folder that contains all the photos and JS files
- templates (a folder that contains all the HTML templates)

To run, please clone the entire project and run on local host

There are some pre-existing admin accounts saved in the file:
Young Travel/data/passwords

You can use those accounts or you can create your own account on the website.

I hope you enjoy the website! It was my first web development project so it's mainly for fun!
